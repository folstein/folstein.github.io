> Don’t threaten us with cutting off your aid. It will not work. I am not a Jew with trembling knees. I am a proud Jew with 3,700 years of civilized history. Nobody came to our aid when we were dying in the gas chambers and ovens. Nobody came to our aid when we were being evicted from our homes and lands. We will stand by our principles. If needed, we will die for them again, with or without your aid.

Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin is quoted as responding to a threat from Senator Joe Biden to cut off aid to Israel.

> Man proceeds in the fog. But when he looks back to judge people of the past, he sees no fog on their path. From his present, which was their faraway future, their path looks perfectly clear to him, good visibility all the way. Looking back, he sees the path, he sees the people proceeding, he sees their mistakes, but not the fog.

Milan Kundera, [Testaments Betrayed: An Essay in Nine Parts](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44382.Testaments_Betrayed)

> The axe forgets but the tree remembers.
